# Automatic brightness adjustment according to external brightness from an LDR on an Arduino.

## ⚙ Behavior
#### Simple Python3 application that receives the external luminance values ​​sent by the microcontroller via Serial.
#### An Arduino UNO with an LDR sensor was used,  connected to the analog port A0, as shown in the schematic below, connected to the computer.

#### To run the application, run the following command:
> python main.py

##### Logically the C code should be running on the Arduino connected to the computer.

## 📝 Comments
- On Windows, the script automatically takes the video information to control the computer screen brightness from a file.
- On Linux, the script takes the name of the active display automatically.


## 🚀 Tecnologies
#### We use [Python3](https://www.python.org/) in the desktop application and [C](https://www.learn-c.org/) in the application that will run on [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). 

## 🔨 Dependencies
#### We use the library [pyserial](https://pypi.org/project/pyserial/) for communication between the Arduino and the computer.
#### To install this dependency you can use the following command:
> pip install pyserial

Make sure you have [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) and [Python3](https://www.python.org/) installed on your computer.
